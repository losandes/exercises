Exercises
=========

> NOTE the tests are meant to be completed in order

Several tests require other libraries to work. Before running these exercises, navigate to this directory in a terminal, and run the following to get the dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

You can run the exercises from this directory using `npm`:

```Shell
# Run all exercises
$ npm test
```

To run tests one-at-a-time, execute the `exercise` with node. For example, to execute the _freezing-and-sealing_ exercise, you can execute it from this directory:

```Shell
$ node SOLID/02-01-freezing-and-sealing/exercise
```

Or you can navigate to that directory and run the exercise from there:

```Shell
$ cd SOLID/02-01-freezing-and-sealing
$ node exercise
```
